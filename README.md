# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Fundamentals: Tools, Roles & Incident Response Frameworks

🔗 **Live Repo:** [github.com/Matt-Solo/soc-analyst-fundamentals](https://github.com/Matt-Solo/soc-analyst-fundamentals)

This project outlines the core structure and operations of a Security Operations Center (SOC). It covers technologies like SIEM, EDR, TIP, and SOAR, analyst roles (L1–L3), and incident response frameworks (NIST and SANS). Ideal for SOC Analyst beginners and cybersecurity learners building foundational knowledge.

## 📘 What is a SOC?

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized team within an organization responsible for continuously monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in real-time.

- 🔍 Threat Monitoring  
- 🚨 Investigating Alerts  
- 🛡️ Responding to Incidents

## 🛠️ Core SOC Technologies & Tools

| Tool/Platform | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) | Combines SIM + SEM to collect and analyze log data from multiple sources to detect threats. |
| **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response) | Detects and investigates suspicious activities on endpoints (e.g., laptops, servers) with real-time response. |
| **TIP** (Threat Intelligence Platform) | Centralizes and automates the collection of external threat intelligence feeds to support proactive defense. |
| **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) | Integrates SOC tools and automates alert triage, investigation, and response workflows. |
| **Ticketing Systems** | Used to track security incidents and manage analyst workflows (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow). |
| **MDR** (Managed Detection and Response) | Outsourced security service that provides 24/7 threat monitoring and incident response. |
